# CMU Meal Tracker

This is a simple single-page web application created for personal use that parses HTML files from the CMU meal plan viewer and displays the historical data in a digestible format.

Can be accessed at [nathanscottmehaffy.github.io/cmu-meal-tracker](nathanscottmehaffy.github.io/cmu-meal-tracker), but requires continuous data from the beginning of the year to function correctly. The CMU meal plan data page in SIO only offers data for the last 30 days, so this is unfortunately currently an unfixable problem.

NOTE: Currently handles fall break incorrectly; will be fixed in the coming days.
